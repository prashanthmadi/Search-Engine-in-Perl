copy wordnet present in the following folder into current directory
/usr/local/nlp/WordNet-1.7.1/dict

I get the error Wide character in print at gettingfiles.pl line 60, <$indata> line 99. while retrieving documents from web. I tried using encode which removes
this error but it also lefts out retrieving more of pages. i had commented out its usage to get all 3000 web pages. This doesn't effects any of my
implementation.



###########################################################################
Please using the following two commands to get results directly using command line

- perl projectcorpus.pl

             this will do all the offline work such as retrieving documents applying pre-process steps and produces tfidf/ folder

- perl project.pl  {query name}

              this will take query name as input and produces output links

below link works fine with code present

############################################################3333
 Below is the step by step procedure


-  perl spider.pl > output  
      
         this will print 1000 links into output

- perl gettingfiles.pl output > file1

        this will get all the files related to links in output into a new folder corpus and a new file which has filename in corpus followed by its link name

- perl computingforeachdoc.pl corpus/ htmltagremoved html_tagremove.pl

          this will take input folder and puts tags removed documents in new folder htmltagremoved

- perl computingforeachdoc.pl htmltagremoved/ tokenizedout newtoken.pl

         this will put tokenized output data in tokenzedout of each file in htmltagremoved

- perl computingforeachdoc.pl tokenizedout/ porterout porter_stemmer.pl

         this will put porterstemmer output of each document in tokenizedout into porterout

- perl computingforeachdoc.pl porterout/ wordfreqout wordfrequency.pl

        this will put the frequency of words in each file of porterout in wordfereqout

- perl stopwordremovalforeachdoc.pl wordfreqout/ stopwordout stopwordremoval.pl stopwords

        this will remove all the stopwords and punctuations from each document and places output files in stopwordout

- perl tf_idf.pl stopwordout/

      this will generate tfidf of each document and stores them in tfidf folder 
      it also generates a storing_doc_distance file which has the distance measure of each document for measuring similarity between documents
      it also generates inverted which keeps track of all the words present in which documents with second column consisting of the total number of documents for that word 
###########################################
this step is required if clustering applied using pre-computed data
using clustering.pl in below

 -  perl similaritybweachdoc.pl tfidf/ storing_doc_distance

       this will compare each input file with other and puts similarity measure in a folder similarity_docs. This would be useful for clustering documents
        here it is and adjacency matrix so i would calculate only half i.e 2->1 wont exist as i have 1->2 which would be the same

#####################################################

- chmod 755 *

- chmod 755 tfidf/*

  to give permissions



-  perl createquerydoc.pl xxxxxx

        xxxxxx represent your input query
         this will create a new query document

-  perl newtoken.pl query > querytoken

         this will print tokenized data in query to querytoken

-  perl porter_stemmer.pl querytoken > querystem

         this will print porter stemmer output of querytoken into querystem

-  perl wordfrequency.pl querystem > queryfreq

            this will print frequency of each term into queryfrq file

-  perl stopwordremoval.pl queryfreq stopwords > querystop

          this will print the data in queryfreq removing stopwords

-  perl comparing.pl inverted querystop storing_doc_distance tfidf/ docsandlinks

          this will compare querystop with the documents in tfidf and prints their similarity

           produces the above results in the file querysearchresult

###############################################
perform this if the above mentioned similarity_docs folder is created

-  perl clustering.pl similarity_docs/ querysearchresult 0.6  docsandlinks

         this will cluster documents based on query and puts the result in clusteredlinks file
     this program does clustering based on previously calculated similarity between each documents
######################################################



-  perl directclusterin.pl tfidf/ querysearchresult 0.6  docsandlinks storing_doc_distance

       this clustering method doesnot uses any premeasured files for similarity.
       this will measure the similarity between files on the fly. This would be better if we cant maintain index of similarity between each and every document

- perl usingword.pl 

       this will intake data in query file and applied wordnet on it to
extend query.
